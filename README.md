### AM8 - A Metal Frame for the Anet A8

This project aims to build a sturdy aluminum frame for your Anet A8, while re-using as many components as possible to keep costs low. This frame can be built for roughly $55, plus the costs of plastic. 

The BOM.pdf file contains all of the parts you need to buy and where to get them.
The Build_Guide.pdf has the build instructions. 

This frame uses Misumi 2040 aluminum extrusions and aluminum corner brackets for primary frame connections, and printed plastic parts for alignment. 

This project only aims to replace the acrylic frame of the Anet A8. The project was designed and built with a stock Anet A8 in mind, in an attempt to reach the widest audience. Many of the existing mods and upgrades should still be compatible with this new frame, although some upgrades may no longer be needed. 

This project does not address any other issues with the Anet A8. Those issues should still be fixed on their own (Such as the mosfet mod). 

Ideally, your Anet A8 is not your only printer, so that rebuilding it does not leave you without a working printer if something should go wrong with your build. 

Build this at your own risk.

##### Optional Parts
The Anet Board Mount can be printed with or without an 80mm fan mount attached. I recommend mounting a fan to help keep the board cool. Any 80mm computer fan should work. If you are using a fan, please print or buy fan guards to prevent fingers or wires from going into the fan.
